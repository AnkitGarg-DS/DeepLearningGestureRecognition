# DeepLearningGestureRecognition
## Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

<li>Thumbs up:  Increase the volume</li>
<li>Thumbs down: Decrease the volume</li>
<li>Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds</li>
<li>Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds</li> 
<li>Stop: Pause the movie</li>
 

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
